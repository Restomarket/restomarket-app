# Apps Directory

This directory contains all application packages in the monorepo.

## Structure

- `web/` - Next.js web application
- `api/` - NestJS API server
- `mobile/` - React Native mobile app (optional)

Each app should have its own `package.json` and can depend on shared packages from the `packages/` directory.
